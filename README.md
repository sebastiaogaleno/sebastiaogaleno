I am a software engineer with experience in developing web applications for different companies around the world: Brazil, Australia and Canada. I have a background in Computer Science, holding a master's degree in the same field, as well as a specialization course in Computer Networks and Information Security.

My passion for programming was ignited during my childhood, driving me to explore the vast opportunities that technology offers. As a programming competition medalist, I have built a strong track record in problem-solving and teamwork. Also, I have expertise in languages like C/C++, Java, PHP, and C#, but I specialized as a full stack developer using JavaScript, Node.js and React.js.

I embrace an analytical approach to problem-solving, breaking down complexity into minor and manageable components to ensure robust and more secure solutions. I firmly believe in the significance of collaboration, marked by open communication, mutual respect, and knowledge sharing, all vital for achieving exceptional results.
